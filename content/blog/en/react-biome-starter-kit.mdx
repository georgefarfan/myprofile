# React + Biome Starter Kit (Chapter I)

👋 Hello everyone, in this post I bring you a starter kit in React with the initial configuration of Biome.
The idea is to explain in simple terms what Biome is, why it can be useful, and how to start taking advantage of it in your projects.

Now that the introduction is done... let's get started! 🚀

---

## ⚡ Requires Node 18+

First, create the React application with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-react-app
npm install
```

You can use nvm to install the required Node version:

```bash
nvm install 18
```

## 🤔 What is Biome?

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is an **all-in-one** tool that combines:

- Code formatter (like Prettier).
- Code linter (like ESLint).
- Preconfigured best practice rules.
- Automatic fixes (`--apply`).

All in a single fast binary written in Rust ⚡.

---

## ✅ Advantages of using Biome

- 🚀 **Fast**: much faster than ESLint + Prettier.
- 🔧 **Automatic corrections** that are easy to apply.
- 📦 **No extra configuration**: comes with best practices by default.
- 🛡️ **Modern rules** for TypeScript, React, and JS.

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages of using Biome

- 🌱 Still **relatively new**, less adopted than ESLint/Prettier.
- 📚 Fewer community plugins (although growing fast).
- 🔄 Migrating from ESLint/Prettier may require adjustments in large projects.

---

## 🛠 Installing and configuring Biome

After creating the React app, install Biome as a development dependency:

```bash
npm i -D @biomejs/biome
```

You must load a Biome configuration file called `biome.json`. This can be done in two ways: automatically using the following command:

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome init
```

Example of **biome.json**:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.7.0/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 100
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "style": {
        "unused-imports": "fix"
      }
    }
  },
  "files": {
    "ignore": ["node_modules", ".next", "out", "dist", "coverage", "public"]
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Setup de Husky y package.json

InstalL Husky and lint-staged:

```bash
npm i -D husky lint-staged
npx husky init
```

Add a pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

Example configuration in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "format": "biome check --apply"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json}": "biome check --apply"
  }
}
```
---

## ▶️ Run Biome rules

To test and apply Biome rules, you can use the scripts configured in `package.json`:

- `npm run lint` → analyzes the code.
- `npm run format` → automatically corrects the code according to the rules.

In addition, if you configured **Husky** with **lint-staged**, these rules will be automatically applied when you make a **commit**.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add **custom rules** in `biome.json` to explore the full potential of Biome.  
- Expand the use of **Git hooks** to enforce formatting, linting, and testing in sync with Biome.  

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Using **Biome** in conjunction with React + Vite + TypeScript is an excellent way to keep your code:

- Clean and tidy 🧹  
- Consistent across the team 👥
- With good practices by default ✅

Plus, by integrating it with **Husky** and **lint-staged**, you ensure that every commit automatically complies with style and quality rules.
