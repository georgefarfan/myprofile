    "aboutMe": "Hi, I’m Jorge Farfan, a Systems Engineer specialized in frontend with more than 12 years of experience building web, mobile, and desktop applications mainly using JavaScript.\n\nThroughout my career, I have worked with a variety of technologies, but I have specialized in React and Angular, creating modern, scalable interfaces focused on user experience. I also have experience with Next.js in high-performance web projects.\n\nIn the mobile field, I developed applications with React Native, NativeScript, and Ionic, bringing web experiences into users’ pockets. On the backend side, I worked with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and NestJS, designing APIs and robust architectures. Finally, for desktop development, I used Electron to build cross-platform applications with the flexibility of the web ecosystem.\n\nI’m always in constant learning, exploring new tools and trends that allow me to grow as a professional. I consider myself a committed team player, motivated to create innovative, high-quality products that truly make a difference.",
